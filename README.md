This repository contains the BASIC source code [published in 1989](https://scholia.toolforge.org/work/Q104870084) for a simple game.
Thanks to the editor who made changes to make it run not only on the SV-328, but also on an MSX. Thanks to friendly Twitter users
I found the [C.U.C. computer journaal](https://scholia.toolforge.org/topic/Q104868980) issue with the source code, whith I hereby (re)release
under an MIT license. Of course, in proper fashion, manually retyped :)
